Once the assets have been returned in exactly the same condition as when they were received, the interest-free security deposit will only be repaid electronically and not in cash. After Optical Network Unit (ONU) approval by zapbytes, the reimbursement will be executed within 45 working days. Any problem with ONU must be fixed by zapbytes within 5 working days of filing a complaint with Zapbytes. Refunds must be handled to the bank account specified at registration or to the bank account or digital wallet connected to the phone number registered with zapbytes. Refunds are not to be made to any other bank accounts. Refunds to customers should not be made in cash or cheques. Zapbytes Technologies Pvt Ltd shall always be the owner of the ONU devices it provides in exchange for a security deposit, and it retains the right to take them back in the event that the connection is terminated, given up, or becomes inactive. Without providing prior notice to the Customer, the Company has the right to alter or discontinue any promotional campaign and to post such changes on its website. The Customer is presumed to have read such postings.
